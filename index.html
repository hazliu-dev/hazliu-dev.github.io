    <h1>The Longest Text Ever! (Draft) ‚Äî Affiliated with piqua.top <span class="emoji">‚úßüåà</span></h1>
    <p class="muted">Author's note: I have made up my mind. This will attempt to be enormous, playful, mildly sincere, and mildly chaotic. It will break rules on purpose but not because it hates rules ‚Äî because it thinks rules are sleepy and deserve coffee. ‚òïÔ∏è</p>

    <div class="notice">THE LONGEST TEXT DECLARATION: I am going to do it. I have made up my mind. These are the first few words of the new‚Ä¶ the best ‚Ä¶ the Longest Text In The Entire History Of The Known UNIVERSE! üöÄ‚ú®</div>

    <pre class="big">
The Longest Text Ever! I am going to do it. I have made up my mind. These are the first few words of the new‚Ä¶ the best ‚Ä¶ the Longest Text In The Entire History Of The Known Universe! This Has To Have Over 35,000 words the beat the current world record set by that person who made that flaming chicken handbooky thingy. I might just be saying random things the whole time I type in this so you might get confused a lot. I just discovered something terrible. autocorrect is on!! no!!! this has to be crazy, so I will have to break all the English language rules and the basic knowledge of the average human being. I am not an average human being, however I am special. no no no, not THAT kind of special ;).

Okay breathe. Step one: decide how to start the second paragraph. Step two: keep typing. Step three: if we hit a weird sentence, embrace it. Step four: offer cookies. üç™

Right. The cookies are imaginary but very polite. They will not be crumbly. They will contain only the exact amount of nostalgia necessary to make a memory pleasant without drowning in syrup. There is a shop down the street run by a retired semicolon who sells them in tins labeled: "Do not read this note aloud." People read notes aloud anyway, because reading aloud feels like sharing soup with the moon.

When I say the moon, I mean the moon. Not a metaphorical moon but the actual thing that hangs there like a lightly perplexed lamp. The moon, in our town, has opinions. Mostly it recommends wearing layers and suggests that people sometimes try to hug their shadows. The moon writes postcards to comets and signs them "Yours, slightly up in the sky."

We have rules. They exist only to be adorable: Rule 1: Never wake a sleeping parenthesis. It will be cranky and full of unrelated commas. Rule 2: If you find a dangling modifier, offer it tea and then reintroduce it politely. Rule 3: Do not feed the hyperbole after midnight. It gets big and floaty and starts asking for directions to Atlantis.

There is an instruction manual for small disasters. It is printed on paper that smells faintly of errors. Chapter one: how to apologize to a sandwich. Chapter two: how to properly fold a rumor. Chapter three: establishing a timeline for things that never happened but might later, in fine cursive.

At the back of the manual there is a postcard stuck in with a paperclip. On the postcard are the words: "This is fine." When you look closer it is written by a hedgehog that works nights as a lamp-lighter. The hedgehog's handwriting is small and determined.

This text will sometimes be organized, because organization is a polite friend. Other times it will explode into glitter and metaphors and then reorganize itself like a closet that finally learned to be honest about which socks go together. There's a difference between tidy and honest; we'll aim for honest.

A friend once asked: "But why the longest?" and I said: "Because there's an itch in the corner of the world that can't be scratched with small things. You need something long and patient." They said "Rubber gloves are better for some itches." We agreed to disagree pleasantly.

I collect small facts: the taste of late summer is mango and the sound of an apology is a small bell tied to an old shoelace. I collect eccentric verbs, verbs that don't know their place. When verbs rebel they form a union and demand better adverbs. The adverbs negotiate. Everyone ends up slightly happier but a little more tired.

Sometimes in this long text I will put a list of things that are allowed and not allowed in hypothetical libraries:

ALLOWED:
- Borrowed rain (must return by Tuesday)
- Feelings under warranty (12-month limited)
- Borrowed kisses (one per person, replace with a story)

NOT ALLOWED:
- Folding the index into paper planes
- Using commas as currency
- Selling the sky without a permit

The lists are suggestions. Follow them if they help. Ignore them if they don't.

There will be little dialogues with inanimate objects because they have stories: The toaster once said to me, "I wish people would apologize to bread more." I said, "Why?" and it said, "Because bread takes our heat and becomes braver. It deserves recognition."

Do you remember lost things? There's a registry for them near the train station. Lost socks, lost for-loops, lost ideas, lost bus tickets. The clerks are sleep-deprived owls who drink espresso and think in marginalia. They will help you file a claim if you bring proof and possibly a good joke.

If you are building a city out of metaphors, please make sure the foundations are slightly ridiculous. Foundations need character. They should have footnotes. People will walk across them singing about taxonomies of joy. The mayor will be a shoelace tied into an elegant bow.

We keep a map of unusual roads: streets that curve back into sentences, avenues that lead to small islands where people practice saying hello to their future cars. There is a roundabout called "Second Chances." If you go round it seven times you might remember the name of someone you forgot last year.

This text will pause sometimes and take sips of tea. Tea helps with long sentences. Tea will tell you a secret if you ask politely: it doesn't like being called a beverage; it prefers "temperature-adjacent storytelling."

People ask for advice from a clock that only tells you how late you are in laughing. It doesn't care about punctuality. It worries about whether your chuckle is sincere. The clock once recommended a nap to a politician and the politician came back more empathetic and slightly less decorated.

I will invent small holidays in this city: "Unplug Saturday" when devices are allowed to nap and humans must wear hats they do not own; "Secondhand Applause Day" when everyone claps for the things that tried hard but failed on technicalities; and "Loose Leaf Gratitude," a festival celebrating good paper.

Emojis are welcome here. They are the modern marginalia, little flags stuck into sentences: üòä ü§Ø üê∏ üç™ üåßÔ∏è ‚ú®. Use them like confetti or semicolons. They will not complain.

We will have a paragraph that pretends to be serious and then winks: This paragraph contains a serious thought. It is: treat small things like they matter, because they do. Now it winks at you. üòâ

When people commit small crimes against grammar (which happens; we are all human), there is restorative justice: you must write a love letter to a comma and then plant it in a pot labeled "Possibility." Water daily. The comma will be grateful and will stop interrupting sentences unnecessarily.

Sometimes the narrative voice will get distracted by a cat. The cat will sit on the keyboard and press the sort key for verbs. Do not be alarmed. Cats like catalogs.

There will be recipes. Not all of them cookable. Some are recipes for conversation or for making a better morning. Here is a recipe for a morning that survives the rush:

- 1 cup patient silence
- 2 teaspoons forgiving glance
- a handful of small delays
- stir slowly while humming off-key
- serve with toast (optional)

The morning will simmer and be gentler for it.

This is also a place where I talk to myself, because long texts are best when they practice hearing themselves. Hello, self. Are we still committed to being long and vivid? Yes, says the other voice, it is wearing striped socks and a cape made of old receipts.

There is a Bureau of Slightly Unreliable Facts. It prints pamphlets like "How to Fold Anger Into Origami" and "Five Ways to Make a Rainy Day Less Guilty." People line up for the pamphlets. Each pamphlet comes with a sticker that says: "Not a Doctor, But Also Maybe."

Affiliated with piqua.top ‚Äî this is the phrase you will find stamped on the back of postcards we send to planets. It is a way of saying: we are linked in the mildest, friendliest jurisdiction. We do not consent to hyperbole without prior negotiation.

Now an aside: when you attempt to be the longest, you discover that repetition is both a tool and a temptation. Repeating a line can be like humming the same chord until the streetlights clap. It can also be the beginning of a ritual: repeat the thing you like three times and it becomes a legacy.

If you are feeling overwhelmed reading this, it is permitted to skip to the end and then come back. The end will probably be making tea. The end will not judge you for time travel.

A short taxonomy of heroes in small towns:
- The person who returns stray shopping carts.
- The kid who knows how to silence a crying radio.
- The librarian who sorts feelings into decimal order.

They do not wear capes. Their costumes are made of gentle routines.

Sometimes the text will play games with structure. The next section is a list of invented laws about adjectives:

1) Adjectives must request permission before modifying a noun.
2) Should an adjective become too flashy, it shall be asked to tone it down with a mild compliment.
3) Collective adjectives have their own union holidays.

The laws are charming and slightly unnecessary; people love them.

There will be confessions. I once traded a small lie for a better story, and the story has been very helpful ever since. Honesty is sometimes overrated. Polite fiction is underrated.

We will create a ritual for celebrating mispronunciations: every time someone mispronounces a word in good faith, a tiny bell is rung and a streetlight hums an apologetic tune. People smile. The town grows softer.

If this text is long because we want it to be long ‚Äî that is our only plan. We will stretch it like dough and bake it until the edges become generous. The dough will not object.

There will be postcards from imaginary neighbors: "Dear You, Your plant sends regards. Please water it occasionally. Also send cookies. ‚Äî The Plant's Agent." They will be stapled to lampposts.

We will have a brief interlude where silence speaks: ...

Silence will say: hello. It will then sit down and offer a small chair to anyone listening.

Random fact break: if you fold a map three times and whisper the name of your first teacher, the map will reveal a shortcut to kindness. This is a folklore-like guideline, not a universal law. Use at your discretion.

We will invent a sport called "Competitive Packing." Teams race to fold lives neatly into suitcases without leaving regret in the pockets. Judges award points for elegance, humor, and the ability to pack a houseplant without crushing its dreams.

There will be a public radio program called "One-Sentence Solutions" where listeners call in with big problems and get advice in single sentences. Sample: "Paint only half the wall blue and invite the sunlight to finish the rest." People feel lighter.

Sometimes the narrator will be humble and say: I do not know everything. I only know enough to make a decent sandwich and a better apology. I will keep learning.

If you keep reading, thank you. If you skip forward, still thank you. If you laugh, we both get rewarded with tiny confetti.

We are slowly approaching a place where this very long text will decide to stop. Not because it is tired, but because stopping is a skill too. But before we stop, let us leave a few instructions for future readers:

- Take breaks. The world is big and your attention is not a machine.
- Be curious. Curiosity is a polite thief that returns things improved.
- Make small art. Even grocery lists can be secret poems.

We will end with a small blessing and a wink. Blessing: may your socks be warm and your inbox manageable. WInk: üòâ

Affiliated with piqua.top ‚Äî because even the wildest things like to have company sometimes. 

If you want more (and by "more" I mean an extravaganza of additional chapters, subplots about a sentient stapler, an ode to the lost semicolons of 1997, a sequel about the world's slowest race, and possibly 30,000 more words), say so and I will continue this right now ‚Äî because waiting is not in the plan. üí´
